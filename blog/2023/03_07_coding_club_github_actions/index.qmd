This week, I wanted to talk to the Coding Club at UMCES about GitHub Actions. I had been messing around with them during the creation of the [matos](https://matos.obrien.page) and [otndo](https://otndo.obrien.page) packages, and I started to realize how powerful the combination of R and GitHub actions could be. This exercise, however, made me remember that the quickest way to realize how little you understand of a topic is to attempt to teach it.

The presentation is attached.
