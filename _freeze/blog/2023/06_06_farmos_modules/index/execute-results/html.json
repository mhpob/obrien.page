Nothing major -- I've purchased a cheap, refurbished SFF (\"slim form factor\") computer for $50 from eBay and installed Ubuntu.\n\nMy family has a [small farmette](https://www.taquitock.farm) in central Virginia and, in my perusal of the [Awesome Self Hosting list on GitHub](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted), I found a neat program called [farmOS](https://farmos.org/). While mostly overkill for my needs, it interfaces with a PostgreSQL and PostGIS database, allowing me to keep track of the amount of eggs from our chickens and geese, in which fields we're grazing the pigs, and more, all in a spatially-explicit manner! It is also open source, and built around the idea of custom extensibility using \"modules\".\n\n## Drupal Modules\n\nfarmOS is built using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), an open-source back end used by a whole bunch of web sites. Drupal allows extending their sites using the modules mentioned above.\n\nIn fact, what originally drew me to the idea of running this program was mapping the assets in my farm onto satellite imagery. This is possible through using a module to access satellite imagery from Mapbox or Google. However, I couldn't find out how to make the Google satellite images show up -- all of my searching led to exchanges like this:\n\n> Person 1: How do I get Google satellite images to appear?     \n> Person 2: Did you install the module?     \n> Person 1: I just did and it works! Thanks!\n\nThe whole thing felt a little bit like the underpants gnomes -- I had no idea how to get from step 2 to step 3.\n\n![](underpants-gnomes.gif)\n\nNominally, the whole thing operates using Drupal; I had no idea what Drupal was as I was coming from a non-computer-mostly-ecology background. To make matters more confusing, there are a few points where the FarmOS developers attempt to steer you away from using canned Drupal add-ons. To make matters EVEN MORE confusing, I am deploying FarmOS in a Docker container which means that the standard instructions to install modules that are provided by Drupal don't necessarily apply.\n\n## Git to the rescue\n\nLuckily the developers are very open, communicative, and welcoming on their Discord channel. [Following this question](https://farmos.discourse.group/t/eggs-module-installation-development/645/2), wherein they reinforced the idea of cloning a GitHub repository, and their [module outline](https://farmos.org/development/module/), where they provide some best practices, I was able to piece together my own workflow. The following assumes that you are accessing your FarmOS instance via the command line.\n\nFirst, change your directory to the `www` folder. My FarmOS Docker container is located in a directory called `farmos`, which contains my `docker-compose.yaml` file and the `www` directory.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncd farmos/www\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, create a directory called `all` with a subdirectory called `modules`. The [FarmOS module development guide](https://farmos.org/development/module/) suggests separate subdirectories for general-purpose modules and those specific to your farm, but I'm not sure I'm going to get that deep into development so I'm skipping that stage.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nmkdir -p all/modules\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow find the GitHub repository (or Gitlab, or whatever flavor of git host you prefer) and clone it into the `www/all/modules` directory. I really wanted to use Google satellite imagery over Mapbox as the images were more up-to-date, so I selected Symbioquine's [fork of the Google Farm Map module](https://github.com/symbioquine/farm_map_google).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncd all/modules\ngit clone https://github.com/symbioquine/farm_map_google.git\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow the module can be found by your FarmOS GUI and then be installed.\n\n## Install the module\n\nTo finish installing the module, log into FarmOS. Click the settings gear, then extend, then search for the module's name in the filter bar. Click \"Install\", and you're done!\n\n## Google API\n\nPart of the reason that FarmOS doesn't ship with the Google satellite module already installed is because Google frequently changes their API and the developers wanted to focus elsewhere. Very fair. In fact, after installing this module and going through the rigmarole of attaining and entering an API key, I still couldn't get the module to work.\n\n## Next steps: Making your own module\n\nSo, here I am with Mapbox working but not updated in the past three years, Google not working and also not updated in the last year, and a farm that has had substantial updates over the last few months. What am I to do?\n\nLuckily, the Commonwealth of Virginia *and* my locality both provide recent satellite imagery to the public. In addition to the Google Maps addon, Symbioqiune had created a [module to use the San Juan Islands' provided imagery](https://github.com/symbioquine/farm_map_sjc). I'll parse out how that works and adapt it to Virginia's imagery in [my next blog post]().",
