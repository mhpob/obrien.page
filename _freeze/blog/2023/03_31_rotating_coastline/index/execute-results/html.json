Because of this, I wind up with a lot of wasted space when trying to plot the coast. Take a look to see what I mean: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLinking to GEOS 3.9.3, GDAL 3.5.2, PROJ 8.2.1; sf_use_s2() is TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ntheme_set(theme_minimal())\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neast_coast <- \n  # Import the Natural Earth states polygon using rnaturalearth\n  ne_states(country = 'united states of america',\n            returnclass = 'sf') |>\n  # crop to the US east coast\n  st_crop(xmin = -82, xmax = -67,\n          ymin = 20, ymax = 48)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout\nall geometries\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = east_coast)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFirstly, I maybe should choose a different spatial polygon -- this one has sunk the entirety of Virginia's eastern shore! I'll ignore that for now and move on.\n\nIf I'm planning to map migrations of fish along the coast (a common occurrence), I only need a little bit along the coast. The Sargasso Sea to the bottom right and Great Lakes to the top left are completely unnecessary.\n\nOne way to address this is to rotate the map so that the axis running from Florida to Maine is more-or-less vertical. My first attempt at this was using an affine transformation as outlined in the [sf package documentation](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf3.html#affine-transformations), but that didn't quite work out.\n\n\n## Affine transformation\n\n[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation):\n\n> an affine transformation...is a geometric transformation that preserves lines and parallelism, but not necessarily Euclidean distances and angles.\n\nIn addition to the sf vignette linked above, the free [Geocomputation with R book](https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/geometric-operations.html#affine-transformations) provides a good outline. I'll use their rotating function below to rotate the polygon counterclockwise by 40 degrees, which should make that N-S axis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Rotation function\nrotation <- function(a){\n  r <- a * pi / 180 # degrees to radians\n  matrix(c(cos(r), sin(r), -sin(r), cos(r)), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)\n} \n\n# Apply affine transformation by rotating the geometry column\nec_affine <- east_coast |> \n  mutate(geometry = geometry * rotation(-40))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ec_affine)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAlright! Now all we need to do is trim the plotting area down and we're in business!\n\nBut... wait a minute. Those axes make no sense. Since when is Maine at -10 degrees latitude? Let's compare how the coordinates were changed.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Original polygon\neast_coast$geometry[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nGeometry set for 1 feature \nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -71.08495 ymin: 43.08381 xmax: -67 ymax: 47.45969\nGeodetic CRS:  +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-67 44.85685, -67.00906 44.8563...\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Affine-transformed polygon\nec_affine$geometry[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nGeometry set for 1 feature \nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -83.64986 ymin: -12.46931 xmax: -80.11661 ymax: -7.52288\nCRS:           NA\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-80.15841 -8.704426, -80.16505 ...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nIt looks like the raw values were changed (as anticipated). However, they're values that don't really make sense in terms of the coordinate reference system with which we started. There is also no longer a CRS listed! So, our polygon is \"spatial\" insofar as it having a spatial (sf), but it's no longer actually something that we know how to place in space.\n\nThis is where the problems begin. \n\nWhat if, for instance, we wanted to add a layer from a different source?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnc <- st_read(system.file(\"shape/nc.shp\", package=\"sf\"),\n              quiet = T)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ec_affine) +\n  geom_sf(data = nc, fill = 'red')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in st_transform.sfc(X[[i]], ...): cannot transform sfc object with missing crs\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nWe get a blank plot and an error -- since the affine-transformed polygon no longer has a CRS, sf and ggplot no longer know where or how to place the new object onto the map.\n\n## Oblique Mercator\n\nA flurry of failed Googling eventually led me to [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66889558/rotate-ggplot2-maps-to-arbitrary-angles), where the author suggests using the [oblique Mercator projection](https://proj.org/operations/projections/omerc.html).\n\nThe difference between the [Mercator](https://proj.org/operations/projections/merc.html) (what we see when we look at something like Google Maps...ish; that's actually [web Mercator](https://proj.org/operations/projections/webmerc.html)), [transverse Mercator](https://proj.org/operations/projections/tmerc.html) (the \"TM\" of \"UTM\" fame), and oblique Mercator lies in what it considers to be the major axis. A Mercator uses the equator, while a transverse Mercator uses a meridian (a particular longitude). Oblique Mercator uses some arbitrary line. This line can be determined using a point (the `+lonc` and `+lat_0` arguments in a PROJ string) and an azimuth (either the `+alpha` or `+gamma`) or two points (`+lat_1`, `+lon_1`, `+lat_2`, `+lon_2`). I've found that providing a rotation away from North in degrees to the `+gamma` argument is what makes the most-intuitive sense to me.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nec_omerc <- east_coast |> \n  st_transform('+proj=omerc +lat_0=40 +lonc=-74 +gamma=-40')\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ec_omerc)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis seems to be doing what we want at first blush. The graticule is rotated in a way that makes sense, and the axes are consistent with what we would think the proper values would be. What does it look like under the hood?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nec_omerc$geometry[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nGeometry set for 1 feature \nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -264991.8 ymin: 436743.3 xmax: 67369.44 ymax: 920600.7\nProjected CRS: +proj=omerc +lat_0=40 +lonc=-74 +gamma=-40\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nMULTIPOLYGON (((61705.39 787254.5, 61232.98 786...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSeems that units are in something like meters and it has a CRS! This means we could add a different spatial polygon:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ec_omerc) +\n  geom_sf(data = nc, fill = 'red')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAwesome! Now to trim the map to our specification with `coord_sf`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ec_omerc) +\n  geom_sf(data = nc, fill = 'red') +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-77, -69), ylim = c(37, 44))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWell, that...didn't work. Why not? Well, in essence, we're providing two different units: `ec_omerc` has units of meters and we've provided units of degrees to `coord_sf`, assuming that it's still using latitude and longitude (a CRS of WGS83/EPSG4326 in this case).\n\nThe hint to solve this is in the help documentation of `coord_sf`, specifically in the `default_crs` argument:\n\n> The default CRS to be used for non-sf layers (which don't carry any CRS information) and scale limits. The default value of NULL means that the setting for crs is used. This implies that all non-sf layers and scale limits are assumed to be specified in projected coordinates. A useful alternative setting is default_crs = sf::st_crs(4326), which means x and y positions are interpreted as longitude and latitude, respectively, in the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84).\n\nWhen we use the `xlim` and `ylim` arguments, it's going to *default* to using the *CRS* that is in the first layer. This would be our oblique Mercator projection, so we would have to provide something in meters. It's so easy to just look at the axes that have been printed and work from there -- so, we're thinking in WGS84/EPSG 4326. We can just tell `coord_sf` that this is our frame of reference usint the `default_crs` argument.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ec_omerc) +\n  geom_sf(data = nc, fill = 'red') +\n  coord_sf(default_crs = 4326,\n           xlim = c(-77, -69), ylim = c(37, 44))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAlmost there. But, wait -- shouldn't North Carolina be in the picture if we're down around 37 degrees latitude? Let's check using the same limits in the original projection.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = east_coast) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-77, -71), ylim = c(37, 44))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYes -- North Carolina is there. So what's going on?\n\nWell, we are seeing 37 degrees latitude in the oblique Mercator projection -- it's the little sliver on the bottom right. If we're rotating everything counter-clockwise by 40 degrees and keeping the same rectangular view, this means that we're adding some latitude at the bottom right of the frame and removing some from the top left. Similarly, we'd add some longitude in the bottom left and remove some from the top right. We need to fudge things now to get what we want included.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ec_omerc) +\n  geom_sf(data = nc, fill = 'red') +\n  coord_sf(default_crs = 4326,\n           xlim = c(-75, -73), ylim = c(34, 44.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere we go! So much less wasted space!\n\n## Summary\n\nIn closing, here are the main takeaways:\n\n-   If you want to rotate your map, you can do it in at least two ways:\n  -   Affine transformation\n  -   Oblique Mercator\n-   If you use the Affine transformation, you're just multiplying you coordinates by a number. This will rotate everything and make it plot-able, but you're now using a custom, undefined coordinate reference system.\n-   If you project the underlying spatial data into some sort of rotated coordinate reference system, like the oblique Mercator outlined here, you have a defined coordinate reference system and can continue to treat your polygon as a spatial object\n-   When plotting with ggplot2, you can continue to use intuitive latitude/longitude to \"zoom in\", but you will likely have to provide a default CRS when the units are not in degrees\n-   Using a rotated projection and a rectangular view port will likely produce unintuitive results -- be prepared to work iteratively and fudge things around.",
